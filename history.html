        <h3 id="years-h3">1977-1987</h3>
        <p class="history-p1">
          The band's history begins in 1968, when a play titled Atomsko
          sklonište and directed by Boško Obradović premiered in People's
          Theatre in Pula. The play featured a choice of the world anti-war
          poetry, including two of Obradović's poems: Kuga u Danangu (against
          Vietnam War) and Vaclavske Namjesti (against Warsaw Pact invasion of
          Czechoslovakia). For several years Obradović had an idea of a rock
          band performing songs featuring his lyrics, and in 1977, in front of
          the kafana Jadran in Pula, which was a gathering place for local
          musicians, he offered his lyrics to a group of musicians. The
          agreement was soon made, and the band Atomsko Sklonište was officially
          formed on February 26, 1977. The first lineup of the band featured
          Bruno Langer (a former Beat Stones, Fantomi, Logaritmi, and Boomerang
          member, bass guitar), Sergio Blažić (vocals), Dragan Gužvan (guitar),
          Eduard Kancelar (keyboards), Saša Dadić (drums), and Rudolf Grum
          (backing vocals). Blažić, Gužvan and Dadić previously performed
          together in the band Hush.

        <p class="history-p2">
          They made their first success with a performance on the 1977 BOOM
          Festival in Novi Sad. In the spring of 1978 they performed at Festival
          Omladina, and during the same year their debut album Ne cvikaj,
          generacijo (Don't Be Afraid, My Generation) was released. The album
          featured hard rock sound, with anti-war and cataclysmic lyrics,
          heavily inspired by hippie ideology, which even in Yugoslavia had
          already been discarded. The album brought hits "Pomorac sam, majko",
          "Kinematograf našeg detinjstva" and "Ne cvikaj, generacijo". The band
          gained the publics attention with the statements that they perform
          punk, unusual clothing style and photographs made by the photographer
          Tone Stojko from Maribor. The band would later record music for the
          song "Zaspao si u mojoj kosi", released by Stojko's wife Neca Falk.

        <p class="history-p3">
          The band's second album, Infarkt (Heart Attack) was released with a
          book of photographs by Stojko, and featured hits "Pakleni vozači" and
          "Djevojka br. 8". After the album release Kancelar left the band due
          to his studies, and was replaced by Paul Bilandžić. The band
          maintained their popularity on their live appearances which featured
          unusual scenery, such as barbed wire, and during a concert in Tivoli
          Hall in Ljubljana there were three hundred yellow umbrellas opened
          above the stage, referring to the band's song "Žuti kišobran" (Yellow
          Umbrella). The band gained a loyal fanbase, although the critics
          generally did not like the lyrics written by Obradović. The band
          recorded their third album U vremenu horoskopa (During the Time of
          Horoscope) on the peninsula Stoja near Pula, in the Mobile One mobile
          studio, previously used by AC/DC. The album was produced by John
          Etchells and Bill Ainsworth. At the time Bilandžić left the band ant
          formed the band Lilihip, and Atomsko sklonište continued as a quartet.

        <p class="history-p4">
          Langer became the band leader and the songwriter. In 1982 the band
          released the album Mentalna higijena (Mental Hygiene), recorded at the
          JAM Studio in London. The album featured Mel Collins on saxophone as a
          guest. During the same year the band went to Florida, where they
          recorded the album Space Generation for the foreign market. The album
          featured nine old Atomsko sklonište songs with English language lyrics
          written by Dražen Met Premet. The band released the album through EEC
          under the name Atomic Shelter. In 1984 the band released the album
          Zabranjeno snivanje (Forbidden Dreaming). The live album Jednom u
          životu (Once in a Lifetime), recorded on the concert held at Tašmajdan
          Stadium on September 15, 1984, and released in 1985, was the last
          album featuring Blažić on vocals. The band had the last performance
          with him on July 21, 1986, after which he died on January 18, 1987.

          At the end of 1987 Atomsko sklonište continued performing in the new
          lineup: Langer (vocals and bass guitar), Ranko Svorcan (guitar) and
          Nikola Duraković (drums). In 1990 the band released the album Criminal
          Tango. In August 1991, at the time when military conflicts in
          Yugoslavia had already begun, Atomsko sklonište performed on
          Gitarijada festival in Zaječar, Serbia. In 1992 the band released the
          album East Europe Man, featuring Wes Talon on vocals. The song
          "Chinese Bike" entered the Billboard Hot 100.[4] In 1995 the band
          released the studio album Terra Mistica. In 1999 Nikola Duraković was
          replaced by Stjepan Bobić (a former Nola, The Spoons, and
          Messerschmitt member).
